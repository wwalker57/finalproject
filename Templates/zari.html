    When I started high school, I had <i> no idea </i> what I wanted to study in college. I knew that <br>
    I wanted to do something related to either math or computer, but I didn't know exactly <br>
    what.  I took a bunch of classes while in high school in things like <i> Photoshop </i> and <i> CGI.</i><br>
    After a family member suggested I look into computer science, I took an Intro to Coding class <br>
    towards the end of my junior year and <i>knew</i> that I wanted to study Computer Science ever since.<br><br>
    <u>To high school students:</u> Try new things until you find out what you're interested in. <i> It's okay </i><br>
    to go into college unsure of your major. It's also okay to change your mind and switch majors if you <br>
    realize you are interested in something else. Start thinking about college applications <i> as soon as possible.</i><br>
    Start thinking about college applications as soon as possible. Do as much research as you can to <br>
    make sure you don't end up in a school or major you don't like.
